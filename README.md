## Problem Title

**SIH 25006:** Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms

## Problem Description

### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, especially in pig and poultry sectors. Disease outbreaks like Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever lead to massive economic losses, threaten food security, and impact livelihood. However, many smallholder farmers lack accessible, actionable platforms to implement proper biosecurity measures.

### Problem Description

There is a need for a user-friendly digital platform to help farmers implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices. This platform must include:

* Customizable risk assessment tools
* Interactive training modules
* Compliance trackers
* Real-time alerts and disease monitoring
* Multilingual, mobile-first user interface

Further, it must support data collection, policy insights, and stakeholder collaboration.

## Expected Outcomes

* Increased awareness and education on biosecurity
* Better farm-level risk management
* Easy access to biosecurity protocols
* Digital compliance logs
* Real-time disease notifications
* Strengthened resilience against disease threats
* Improved public sector planning & surveillance

## Problem Creator's Organization

Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme

Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution

The Digital Farm Management Portal will provide:

* A user-friendly portal with risk assessment tools
* SOP and checklist automation
* IoT-based sensor integration for continuous monitoring
* Alerts and analytic insights to prevent outbreaks
* Mobile app for offline/online data entry and training
* Dashboard for farm managers and regulators

### How it Addresses the Problem

* Makes biosecurity protocols accessible to small & marginal farmers
* Enables real-time disease monitoring and notification
* Supports traceability and compliance for regulatory audits

### Innovation and Uniqueness

* Combines IoT, mobile, and cloud technologies designed specifically for livestock biosecurity
* Offline-first architecture for rural connectivity
* Dashboard-based visualization and analytics to support both farmers and authorities

## Technical Approach

### Technologies

* **Frontend**: React/Flutter
* **Backend**: Node.js/Python
* **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
* **IoT**: LoRaWAN/MQTT for sensor data
* **Hosting**: Cloud-based Kubernetes

### Methodology

1. Requirements gathering
2. UI/UX design and prototyping
3. Backend API development
4. IoT sensor gateway integration
5. Mobile app development
6. Testing and pilot deployment
7. Feedback loop and scaling

## Feasibility and Viability

The system uses open-source technologies, minimizing cost and ensuring scalability. It is intended for use by farms of all sizes, enhancing adoption potential. Collaboration with veterinary bodies and training programs ensures long-term viability.

### Challenges & Mitigation

* **Challenge**: Limited digital literacy among farmers.
  **Mitigation**: Use of graphical UI, regional languages, in-app guidance.
* **Challenge**: Poor connectivity in rural areas.
  **Mitigation**: Offline-first mobile design.

## Impact and Benefits

* Reduced economic losses due to controlled disease outbreaks
* Empowerment of marginal farmers via technology
* Improved national preparedness against zoonotic diseases
* Enhanced environmental sustainability via better farm practices

## Research and References

* FAO Biosecurity Guidelines
* Government of India Animal Husbandry Department Reports
* Research articles on smart livestock farming and digital traceability
* OIE guidelines on disease monitoring
